# Known Issues

This document outlines the current known issues in the Procedural Mini Game Generator project.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL STATUS: PROJECT CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONAL

**Last Updated**: January 25, 2025

The project is currently in a broken state and cannot be built or run. This is a comprehensive list of all known issues that need to be resolved.

## Frontend Issues (165+ TypeScript Errors)

### üî¥ Critical Build-Breaking Issues
1. **Type System Breakdown**: Fundamental type mismatches across the entire codebase
2. **Missing Interface Implementations**: Core interfaces not properly implemented
3. **Test Framework Chaos**: Mix of Jest and Vitest syntax causing compilation failures
4. **Broken Component Props**: Component interfaces don't match their implementations

### Major Problem Areas

#### Type Definition Issues (50+ errors)
- `Level` interface missing `tiles` and `spawnPoints` properties
- `Entity` interface structure mismatch (missing `position`, `properties`)
- `GenerationConfig` type completely missing or mismatched
- `ValidationResult` ambiguous references between multiple namespaces

#### Component System Failures (40+ errors)
- `LevelRenderer` component props incompatible with usage
- `OptimizedCanvasRenderer` missing required properties
- `ValidatedInput` component interface mismatch
- Missing components referenced in tests

#### Service Layer Breakdown (30+ errors)
- API service function signatures don't match usage
- Progressive loader service type incompatibilities
- SignalR service connection issues
- Error handling service missing methods

#### Test Infrastructure Collapse (35+ errors)
- Jest/Vitest syntax mixing throughout test files
- Mock implementations incompatible with actual interfaces
- Test utilities missing or incorrectly typed
- Canvas and DOM mocking failures

## Backend Issues (59+ Compilation Errors)

### üî¥ Critical Compilation Failures
1. **Missing Dependencies**: Test files in main project without test packages
2. **Namespace Conflicts**: Multiple `ValidationResult` types causing ambiguity
3. **Interface Implementation Gaps**: Services not implementing required interfaces
4. **Missing Type Definitions**: Core types like `GenerationConfig` not found

### Major Problem Areas

#### Service Implementation Failures (25+ errors)
- `ValidationService` doesn't implement `IValidationService` properly
- `JobStatusService` missing required interface methods
- Terrain generators missing interface implementations
- Configuration parser incomplete

#### Type System Issues (20+ errors)
- `ValidationResult` ambiguous between 3+ different namespaces
- `FileResult` conflicts with ASP.NET Core types
- Missing types: `GenerationConfig`, `PreviewRequest`, `ValidationError`
- SignalR hub configuration incompatible

#### Architecture Problems (14+ errors)
- Test files mixed with production code
- Circular dependencies between projects
- Missing project references
- Incomplete dependency injection setup

## Infrastructure Issues

### Build System
- **Frontend**: Cannot compile due to TypeScript errors
- **Backend**: Cannot compile due to missing types and interfaces
- **Docker**: Build process fails due to compilation errors
- **CI/CD**: All automated builds failing

### Development Environment
- **Hot Reload**: Not functional due to compilation errors
- **Debugging**: Cannot attach debugger to broken builds
- **Testing**: No tests can run due to framework issues
- **Linting**: ESLint failing due to TypeScript errors

## Current Workarounds

### None Available
There are currently no viable workarounds. The project must be fixed systematically.

## Deployment Status

- **Development**: ‚ùå Non-functional
- **Testing**: ‚ùå Cannot run tests
- **Staging**: ‚ùå Cannot build
- **Production**: ‚ùå Completely broken

## Recovery Plan

### Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (Week 1)
1. **Backend Stabilization**
   - Remove test files from main project
   - Fix namespace conflicts for `ValidationResult`
   - Create missing type definitions
   - Implement missing interface methods

2. **Frontend Type System Repair**
   - Fix core type definitions (`Level`, `Entity`, `GenerationConfig`)
   - Resolve component prop mismatches
   - Standardize on Vitest for all tests
   - Fix API service signatures

### Phase 2: Component System Rebuild (Week 2)
1. **Component Interface Alignment**
   - Fix all component prop interfaces
   - Implement missing components
   - Resolve test component mismatches
   - Fix canvas rendering issues

2. **Service Layer Reconstruction**
   - Complete service interface implementations
   - Fix API client/server contract mismatches
   - Resolve SignalR configuration
   - Implement proper error handling

### Phase 3: Test Infrastructure Rebuild (Week 3)
1. **Test Framework Standardization**
   - Convert all tests to Vitest
   - Fix mock implementations
   - Resolve test utilities
   - Implement proper test setup

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Fix end-to-end test scenarios
   - Resolve API integration tests
   - Implement proper test data
   - Fix accessibility testing

### Phase 4: Build System Recovery (Week 4)
1. **Build Process Repair**
   - Fix Docker configurations
   - Resolve CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement proper deployment
   - Fix development environment

## Estimated Recovery Time

- **Minimum Viable Product**: 4-6 weeks of full-time development
- **Full Feature Recovery**: 8-12 weeks
- **Production Ready**: 12-16 weeks

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Stop all feature development** until core issues are resolved
2. **Assign dedicated team** to systematic issue resolution
3. **Implement proper project management** for recovery process
4. **Create detailed technical debt tracking**
5. **Establish quality gates** to prevent future degradation

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Project may need complete rewrite if issues are too deeply embedded
- **Medium Risk**: Significant development time required for recovery
- **Low Risk**: Some components may be salvageable with proper refactoring
