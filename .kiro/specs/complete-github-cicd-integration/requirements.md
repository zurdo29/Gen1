# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The complete GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is experiencing failures across multiple jobs including test-backend, test-frontend, build-and-push, and deploy stages. This feature will systematically identify and resolve all issues preventing the entire CI/CD pipeline from running successfully, ensuring reliable automated testing, building, containerization, and deployment processes across the full application lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete CI/CD Pipeline Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to run successfully from testing through deployment so that I can confidently merge code and deploy to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test-backend job runs in GitHub Actions THEN it SHALL complete successfully without errors
2. WHEN the test-frontend job runs in GitHub Actions THEN it SHALL complete successfully without errors
3. WHEN the build-and-push job runs THEN it SHALL successfully build and push Docker images for both backend and frontend
4. WHEN the deploy job runs THEN it SHALL successfully deploy the application to the target environment
5. WHEN any job fails THEN subsequent dependent jobs SHALL be skipped appropriately
6. WHEN all jobs complete successfully THEN the entire pipeline SHALL be marked as successful
7. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN job dependencies SHALL be properly orchestrated and executed in the correct order

### Requirement 2: Backend Test Discovery and Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all backend tests to be discovered and executed properly so that .NET code quality is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dotnet test runs THEN all .NET test projects SHALL be discovered correctly
2. WHEN test discovery occurs THEN all [Fact] and [Theory] test methods SHALL be found
3. WHEN backend tests execute THEN proper test output SHALL be generated with detailed logging
4. WHEN test execution completes THEN exit codes SHALL properly reflect success or failure
5. WHEN backend tests run THEN code coverage information SHALL be collected if configured

### Requirement 3: Frontend Test Discovery and Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all frontend tests to be discovered and executed properly so that React/TypeScript code quality is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm test runs THEN all frontend test files SHALL be discovered correctly
2. WHEN test discovery occurs THEN all test suites and test cases SHALL be found
3. WHEN frontend tests execute THEN proper test output SHALL be generated with detailed logging
4. WHEN test execution completes THEN exit codes SHALL properly reflect success or failure
5. WHEN frontend tests run THEN linting and type checking SHALL pass successfully

### Requirement 4: Project Dependencies and References

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all project dependencies to be correctly resolved so that both backend and frontend tests can access required functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dotnet restore runs THEN all NuGet packages SHALL be restored successfully
2. WHEN npm ci runs THEN all Node.js packages SHALL be installed successfully
3. WHEN project references are resolved THEN all inter-project dependencies SHALL be available
4. WHEN tests compile THEN all required assemblies and modules SHALL be accessible
5. WHEN dependency resolution occurs THEN version conflicts SHALL be resolved appropriately
6. WHEN build process runs THEN all projects SHALL build in the correct order

### Requirement 5: Build Process Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD build process to be efficient and reliable so that feedback is provided quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL use optimal build order and caching
2. WHEN dotnet commands execute THEN they SHALL use appropriate verbosity for debugging
3. WHEN npm commands execute THEN they SHALL use appropriate caching and optimization
4. WHEN build artifacts are created THEN they SHALL be properly organized and accessible
5. WHEN build steps execute THEN they SHALL fail fast on errors with clear messages
6. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN it SHALL complete within reasonable time limits

### Requirement 6: Docker Containerization and Registry

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Docker images to be built and pushed successfully so that applications can be deployed consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker build runs THEN both backend and frontend images SHALL be created successfully
2. WHEN Docker images are built THEN they SHALL use multi-stage builds for optimization
3. WHEN images are pushed THEN they SHALL be tagged appropriately with version information
4. WHEN registry authentication occurs THEN it SHALL use proper credentials and permissions
5. WHEN build context is prepared THEN it SHALL include all necessary files and exclude unnecessary ones
6. WHEN images are created THEN they SHALL be scanned for security vulnerabilities if configured

### Requirement 7: Deployment Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment process to work reliably so that new features reach users successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment runs THEN it SHALL only execute on successful builds from main branch
2. WHEN deployment occurs THEN it SHALL use the correct environment configuration
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN it SHALL verify that services are running correctly
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback information
5. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN it SHALL update any necessary service registrations or configurations

### Requirement 8: Error Reporting and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages and diagnostic information when any part of the pipeline fails so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test failures occur THEN detailed error messages SHALL be displayed with stack traces
2. WHEN build errors happen THEN specific file and line information SHALL be provided
3. WHEN dependency issues arise THEN missing packages or references SHALL be clearly identified
4. WHEN Docker build fails THEN layer-specific error information SHALL be provided
5. WHEN deployment fails THEN infrastructure and service-specific errors SHALL be reported
6. WHEN the pipeline fails THEN logs SHALL contain sufficient information for troubleshooting
7. WHEN errors are reported THEN they SHALL include context about the failing component and stage
