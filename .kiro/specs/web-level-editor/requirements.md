# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing procedural mini-game generator from a console application into a comprehensive web-based level editor and generator. The web application will provide an intuitive visual interface for configuring generation parameters, real-time preview of generated levels, and export capabilities for multiple game engines and formats.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to access the procedural generator through a web browser, so that I can use it without installing software and share it easily with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the web application THEN the system SHALL load a responsive web interface
2. WHEN the web application loads THEN the system SHALL display the main level editor interface within 3 seconds
3. WHEN a user accesses the application from mobile or tablet THEN the system SHALL provide a touch-friendly responsive design
4. WHEN the application encounters loading errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a level designer, I want to configure generation parameters through a visual interface, so that I can easily experiment with different settings without writing configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the parameter configuration panel THEN the system SHALL display all available generation options with clear labels
2. WHEN a user modifies any parameter THEN the system SHALL validate the input in real-time and show validation feedback
3. WHEN a user sets invalid parameter combinations THEN the system SHALL highlight conflicts and suggest corrections
4. WHEN a user wants to save a configuration THEN the system SHALL allow saving custom presets with descriptive names
5. WHEN a user loads a saved preset THEN the system SHALL restore all parameters to the saved state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to see a real-time visual preview of generated levels, so that I can immediately understand how parameter changes affect the output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes generation parameters THEN the system SHALL update the level preview within 500ms
2. WHEN the system generates a level preview THEN it SHALL display terrain, entities, and spawn points with distinct visual representations
3. WHEN a user hovers over level elements THEN the system SHALL show detailed information tooltips
4. WHEN generation takes longer than 2 seconds THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator
5. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL display the error message and maintain the previous valid preview

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to export generated levels in multiple formats, so that I can integrate them into different game engines and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks export THEN the system SHALL offer multiple format options (JSON, XML, CSV, Unity prefab data)
2. WHEN a user selects an export format THEN the system SHALL generate and download the file within 3 seconds
3. WHEN exporting large levels (100x100+) THEN the system SHALL show progress feedback during export
4. WHEN export fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and suggest solutions
5. WHEN a user exports to Unity format THEN the system SHALL include positioning data compatible with Unity's coordinate system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a level designer, I want to manually edit generated levels, so that I can fine-tune specific areas while keeping the procedural base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a level tile THEN the system SHALL allow changing the terrain type through a context menu
2. WHEN a user drags entities THEN the system SHALL update their positions in real-time with snap-to-grid functionality
3. WHEN a user adds or removes entities THEN the system SHALL validate placement rules and show warnings for invalid placements
4. WHEN a user makes manual edits THEN the system SHALL track changes and allow reverting to the original generated state
5. WHEN a user saves manual edits THEN the system SHALL preserve both the generation parameters and manual modifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to share level configurations and generated levels with my team, so that we can collaborate on level design decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates a level THEN the system SHALL create a shareable URL that includes all parameters
2. WHEN another user opens a shared URL THEN the system SHALL load the exact same configuration and generated level
3. WHEN a user wants to share a level THEN the system SHALL provide options to share via URL, download configuration file, or export image preview
4. WHEN sharing large configurations THEN the system SHALL compress the URL parameters to keep links manageable
5. WHEN a shared link is accessed after 30 days THEN the system SHALL still load the configuration successfully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to batch generate multiple level variations, so that I can create diverse content efficiently for my game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables batch generation THEN the system SHALL allow specifying the number of variations to generate (1-50)
2. WHEN batch generation starts THEN the system SHALL show progress for each level being generated
3. WHEN batch generation completes THEN the system SHALL display thumbnails of all generated levels
4. WHEN a user clicks on a batch result thumbnail THEN the system SHALL load that specific level for detailed viewing and editing
5. WHEN batch generation is requested for more than 10 levels THEN the system SHALL process them in background and notify when complete

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the generator, I want to access the generation functionality through a REST API, so that I can integrate it into my own tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to /api/generate with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL return the generated level data in JSON format
2. WHEN API requests include invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with detailed validation error messages
3. WHEN API generation takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 202 with a job ID for status polling
4. WHEN a client polls job status THEN the system SHALL return current progress and completion status
5. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 with retry-after headers
