# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Procedural Mini-game Generator is a system that automatically produces playable 2D levels for mini-games from minimal JSON configuration. Each execution generates a unique map with enemies, objects, and game elements, packaging everything into a ready-to-test executable. The system enables rapid prototyping and iterative testing of procedurally generated game content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to define generation parameters through a JSON configuration file, so that I can control the complexity and style of generated levels without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSON configuration file is provided THEN the system SHALL read parameters including width, height, number of enemies, terrain types, and items
2. WHEN the JSON contains invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which parameters are incorrect
3. WHEN no JSON file is specified THEN the system SHALL use default configuration values
4. IF the JSON file is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL use default values for missing fields and log warnings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the system to generate procedural tile-based maps, so that each execution produces unique and varied level layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation is triggered THEN the system SHALL create a tile mesh with ground, walls, water, and other terrain types
2. WHEN generating terrain THEN the system SHALL apply basic rules or algorithms such as fixed borders, Perlin noise, or cellular automata
3. WHEN placing terrain elements THEN the system SHALL ensure the generated level is navigable and playable
4. WHEN using the same seed value THEN the system SHALL generate identical maps for reproducible testing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want dynamic entities to be automatically placed in valid positions, so that generated levels contain appropriate gameplay elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a level THEN the system SHALL place enemies in random valid positions according to configuration parameters
2. WHEN placing items THEN the system SHALL ensure they are accessible to the player
3. WHEN positioning entities THEN the system SHALL avoid placing them inside walls or unreachable areas
4. WHEN the configuration specifies entity counts THEN the system SHALL place the exact number requested or log if impossible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to trigger generation from the editor without entering game mode, so that I can quickly iterate on level designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in the editor THEN the system SHALL provide a window or quick command to trigger generation
2. WHEN triggering generation THEN the system SHALL allow specifying which JSON configuration file to use
3. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL display the generated level in the editor for immediate review
4. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages in the editor interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to test multiple generated prototypes iteratively, so that I can evaluate randomness and gameplay quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing multiple generations THEN the system SHALL produce different results each time (unless using the same seed)
2. WHEN reviewing generated levels THEN the system SHALL allow quick regeneration with the same or modified parameters
3. WHEN testing gameplay THEN the system SHALL ensure all generated levels are playable and meet basic quality standards
4. WHEN adjusting parameters THEN the system SHALL allow real-time modification of enemy count, level size, and obstacle density

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want automated build processes, so that I can quickly create executable demos of generated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a command-line or script process to compile a Windows executable
2. WHEN building executables THEN the system SHALL automatically include the generated level data
3. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL produce a standalone executable ready for testing
4. WHEN build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested fixes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want multiple generation algorithms and customization options, so that I can create diverse types of levels and gameplay experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring generation THEN the system SHALL offer modules for different algorithms (noise, caverns, mazes)
2. WHEN using advanced parameters THEN the system SHALL support power-up systems, checkpoints, and event triggers
3. WHEN selecting generation methods THEN the system SHALL allow combining multiple algorithms for hybrid approaches
4. WHEN customizing gameplay THEN the system SHALL support configurable game mechanics and rules

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to export and modify generated levels, so that I can fine-tune procedural content manually when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a level is generated THEN the system SHALL provide an option to export it as an editable JSON file
2. WHEN exporting levels THEN the system SHALL include all entity positions, terrain data, and metadata
3. WHEN importing modified level JSON THEN the system SHALL validate the data and load it correctly
4. WHEN level data is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about what needs to be corrected

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want AI-powered content generation for narrative elements, so that generated levels feel more complete and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating levels THEN the system SHALL optionally integrate AI services to create item descriptions
2. WHEN placing NPCs THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate dialogue content using AI
3. WHEN creating levels THEN the system SHALL generate contextually appropriate level names
4. WHEN AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to predefined content templates

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want visual customization options, so that generated levels can match different art styles and themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring generation THEN the system SHALL provide a graphical selector for color palettes
2. WHEN choosing visual styles THEN the system SHALL offer different tile sets and visual themes
3. WHEN applying visual customization THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent art style throughout the level
4. WHEN visual resources are missing THEN the system SHALL use default assets and log warnings

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want comprehensive validation and documentation, so that I can confidently use the system and understand all its capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the system THEN all generated levels SHALL be validated for playability and fun factor
2. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a clear guide for JSON parameters and generation workflow
3. WHEN encountering issues THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN learning the system THEN the documentation SHALL include examples and best practices for different types of games
